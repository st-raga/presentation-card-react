            <p>As a seasoned QA Engineer with 8 years of experience in Venezuela and Chile, I have honed my skills in both manual and automation testing. My work has involved utilizing Cascade and Agile methodologies, as well as implementing various types of testing and adhering to best practices.</p>
            <p>In 2021, I moved to Canada to further my education in Computer Programming at Seneca College, graduating in December 2022. This program significantly enhanced my technical skills, enabling me to expand my knowledge of JavaScript and HTML5 and build web applications with React and Next, as well as simple web services (APIs) using Node.js, Express, and Mongo.</p>
            <p>I am highly familiar with frameworks and tools such as Jest, Cypress, TestCafe, and Selenium. My approach to software development emphasizes the importance of testing throughout all stages of the process. I am passionate about ensuring software quality and committed to applying my knowledge and experience to contribute to the success of any project.</p>
